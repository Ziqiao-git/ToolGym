We're looking for a cozy spot to catch up and chat! Can you help us find a meeting point between our 3 locations? We'd love to find a single 'cafe' (must be of type 'cafe') where we can all gather comfortably, ideally somewhere where the estimated driving time from each of our places to the cafe is as close as possible. Please report the Name and Place ID of the cafe.",
