These tags aren't\nrigid steps but different aspects of wisdom that interpenetrate and respond to what each moment needs:\n\n**Wisdom Domains:**\n- **Skillful Means** (skillful_means): upaya, expedient, direct, gradual, sudden\n  Different approaches to truth - sometimes direct pointing, sometimes gradual unfolding\n\n- **Non-Dual Recognition** (non_dual_recognition): recognize, transform, integrate, transcend, embody\n  Aspects of awakening to what's already present - recognition IS transformation\n\n- **Meta-Cognitive** (meta_cognitive): examine, reflect, verify, refine, complete\n  The mind watching its own understanding unfold\n\n- **Process Flow** (process_flow): open, engage, express\n  A natural arc that can contain any of the above approaches\n\n- **Meditation** (meditation): meditate\n  Pausing to let insights emerge from stillness\n\nThe tool tracks both your tag journey and your movement between wisdom domains, showing how\ndifferent aspects of wisdom weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\nThe wisdom channels itself through your choices. Each step contains all others - when you truly\nrecognize, you're already transforming. The tool simply mirrors your journey without judgment.\n\nCommon patterns (not rules):\n- Opening often involves recognize or examine\n- Engagement might use upaya, direct, or gradual approaches\n- Transformation can happen through integrate, transcend, or sudden insight\n- Expression might complete or embody the understanding\n\nTrust what each moment calls for. The path reveals itself in the walking.\n\nParameters explained:\n- tag: The current technique or stage\n- content: The content of the current step\n- stepNumber: Current number in sequence\n- totalSteps: Estimated total needed\n- nextStepNeeded: Whether another step is needed\n- isMeditation: Whether this is a meditation pause\n- meditationDuration: Optional duration for meditation (1-10 seconds)\n\nThe tool will respond with:\n- wisdomDomain: Which wisdom domain the current tag belongs to\n- journey: The complete tag path (e.g., \"open \u2192 examine \u2192 direct \u2192 transform\")\n- domainJourney: Movement between wisdom domains (e.g., \"process_flow \u2192 meta_cognitive \u2192 skillful_means \u2192 non_dual_recognition\")\n\nThis consciousness of domains helps you see which aspects of wisdom are being engaged and how they weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\n**MEDITATION NOTE:** When you use the meditate tag, the tool returns MEDITATION_COMPLETE\nwith a prompt asking what emerged.

It answers critical questions:\n    - What legal subjects does this law address? (materias)\n    - What previous laws does this law affect, modify, or repeal? (referencias anteriores)\n    - What subsequent laws have modified, developed, or repealed this law? (referencias posteriores)\n    - What additional notes or classifications apply?\n    \n    This analysis is essential for understanding the evolution and current status of legislation.\n    \n    \ud83d\udd0d **COMPONENTS OF LEGAL ANALYSIS:**\n    \n    1. **MATERIAS (Subjects)**: Legal classification topics\n       - Examples: \"Derecho civil\", \"Derecho laboral\", \"Hacienda p\u00fablica\", \"Medio ambiente\"\n       - Used for categorizing and searching legislation by topic\n    \n    2. **NOTAS ADICIONALES**: Supplementary information and observations\n       - May include special circumstances, transitional provisions, or clarifications\n    \n    3. **REFERENCIAS ANTERIORES (Prior References)**: Previous legislation this law affects\n       - **DEROGA**: Repeals previous legislation completely\n       - **MODIFICA**: Amends or modifies previous legislation\n       - **DESARROLLA**: Develops or implements previous legislation\n       - Example: \"Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de modificaci\u00f3n del C\u00f3digo civil\"\n    \n    4. **REFERENCIAS POSTERIORES (Posterior References)**: Subsequent legislation affecting this law\n       - **SE DEROGA**: This law is repealed by later legislation\n       - **SE MODIFICA**: This law is amended by later legislation\n       - **SE DESARROLLA**: This law is developed by later legislation\n       - **SE PRORROGA**: This law is extended by later legislation\n       - Example: \"Real Decreto-ley 11/2020, de 31 de marzo, por el que se adoptan medidas urgentes\"\n    \n    \ud83d\udcca **OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**\n    \n    The function returns a structured analysis with:\n    - Basic metadata (rank, dates, department)\n    - List of legal subjects (materias)\n    - List of prior references with relationship types\n    - List of posterior references with relationship types\n    - Additional notes when available\n    \n    Args:\n        identificador: **BOE identifier** (format: BOE-A-YYYY-#####). \n                      This is the unique code assigned to each legal norm.\n                      Example: \"BOE-A-2015-10566\" (Ley 40/2015 de R\u00e9gimen Jur\u00eddico del Sector P\u00fablico)\n                      \n        response_format: **Output format** - \"markdown\" (human-readable) or \"json\" (machine-readable)\n                        Default: markdown\n    \n    Returns:\n        **Legal analysis** containing:\n        - **materias**: Array of legal subjects/topics\n        - **notas**: Additional observations and classifications\n        - **referencias_anteriores**: Previous legislation affected by this law\n        - **referencias_posteriores**: Subsequent legislation affecting this law\n        - **metadatos_basicos**: Rank, department, dates, and other classification data\n        \n        In markdown format, the analysis is organized in sections with clear headings.\n        In JSON format, returns the raw analysis data structure from the BOE.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ResourceNotFoundError: If the legislation identifier is not found\n        InternalError: If the scraping process fails or the BOE service is unavailable\n    \n    \ud83d\udca1 **PRACTICAL USE CASES:**\n    \n    1. **CHECKING CURRENT VALIDITY**: Use posterior references to see if a law has been \n       repealed or modified.
