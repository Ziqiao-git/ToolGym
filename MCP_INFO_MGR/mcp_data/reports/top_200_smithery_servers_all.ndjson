It transforms the traditional \"prompt-then-code-dump\" workflow into a systematic, specification-driven process where specifications don't serve code\u2014code serves specifications.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f The Power Inversion: A New Development Paradigm\nFor decades, code has been king. Specifications were scaffolding\u2014built, used, then discarded once \"real work\" began. PRDs guided development, design docs informed implementation, but these were always subordinate to code. Code was truth. Everything else was, at best, good intentions.\n\nSpec-Driven Development inverts this power structure: \n\nSpecifications Generate Code: The PRD isn't a guide\u2014it's the source that produces implementation\nExecutable Specifications: Precise, complete specs that eliminate the gap between intent and implementation\nCode as Expression: Code becomes the specification's expression in a particular language/framework\nLiving Documentation: Maintain software by evolving specifications, not manually updating code\nThis transformation is possible because AI can understand complex specifications and implement them systematically. But raw AI generation without structure produces chaos. DinCoder provides that structure through GitHub's proven Spec Kit methodology. \n\nPlugin install :\n**Step 1: Add the DinCoder marketplace**\n```bash\n# In Claude Code\n/plugin marketplace add flight505/dincoder-plugin\n```\n\n**Step 2: Install the plugin**\n```bash\n/plugin install dincoder\n```", "iconUrl": "https://spjawbfpwezjfmicopsl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/server-icons/e3c7d336-d917-43e9-9b49-84df8af893f2.jpg", "verified": false, "useCount": 364, "remote": true, "createdAt": "2025-09-10T15:40:35.314Z", "homepage": "https://smithery.ai/server/@flight505/mcp_dincoder"}
